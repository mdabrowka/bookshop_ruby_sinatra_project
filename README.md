# bookshop_ruby_sinatra_project
For this project project I built a stock management web app for a foreign-fiction-focused bookseller.
UX design methodologies of building proto-personas and user journey informed the design of my user interface. 
I further validated it through user testing. I used the Ruby framework Sinatra to link my SQL database with HTML and CSS.
